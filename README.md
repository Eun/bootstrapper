# bootstrapper

Simple bootstrapper using resources.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo (duh!)  

2. Place all resources you want to include in the `Resources` dir  

3. Rename the project to the file you want to execute after the extracting is done.  

   **Example**: You have a file named `setup.exe` in the Resources folder:  
       Rename boostrapper to setup  
   Or the hard way: go to `main.cpp` and change the `binPath`
